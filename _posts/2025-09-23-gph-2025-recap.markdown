This is my first recap post! I have a lot to say about various hunts, and there has been a lot of noise about this one in particular. I'll warn you that this post contains unmarked spoilers for GPH 2025, including many puzzles and a few answers, so I recommend only reading it after trying out the hunt.

This was my fifth GPH. Instead of hunting with my usual team, the ECs, I solved with Vehemence, a group I've only heard good things about. My team of 8, <b>Vehem-I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly</b>, finished at rank 36 after slightly more than a week. As usual, Galactic made a cool hunt that I enjoyed, especially because I saw a lot of it<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup>. With no ECPH on the horizon<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a></sup>, I'm glad Galactic wrote a proper difficult hunt once again. I'll preemptively apologize for not including any links to puzzles, but due to the nature of this hunt, the puzzle pages are mostly just empty spaces. It was up to the solvers to put the pieces in them. In this writeup, I put the names of rounds in <b>bold</b> and the puzzles in <i>italics</i>.

<h1>Day 1: Bon voyage!</h1>

The hunt started at 1:28AM, but instead of responsibly sleeping and solving next morning with a late-starting team, I decided to stay awake. The site predictably couldn't handle the thousands of puzzlers smashing their F5 buttons, but after it settled and the puzzles unlocked, what I saw is best described as really cool. I first looked at <i>Four Pieces</i> and while I didn't know much, I thought it was a cute aha. It was our first solve, and <i>Ring Cycle</i> fell shortly after. The next puzzle I eyed was <i>A Confusing Journey</i>, a direction-following puzzle where the place at the end of each instruction shares its name with the place at the beginning of a different instruction, making a cycle. We solved most of it, then I went to sleep at the unhealthy time of 4:00, shortly after which it was solved.

I really like this round! I thought that out of all rounds, it made the best use of the hunt-wide structural gimmick, because in many puzzles, arranging the pieces is part of the puzzle in itself. This is true for both <i>Four Pieces</i> and <i>A Confusing Journey</i>, as well as some other puzzles I didn't look at (such as <i>The Blue Theatre</i><sup id="fnref3"><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a></sup> and <i>Ring Cycle</i>).

<h1>Day 2: Abandon all hope, ye who sail here</h1>

When I woke up, we had solved more stuff, but were still in the <b>Pan's Laboratory</b> round. I identified <i>Chains</i> as being a map of the Pacific Ocean, and had some trouble extracting because some islands got skipped - in particular I had Sumba instead of Timor for a long time, but could still solve the puzzle. Then I bounced between <i>Picturini Puzzlini</i> and <i>square</i>, trying to get out 9th solve, but neither was landing until Codie decided to be a saviour and found the first TikTok account for <i>Picturini Puzzlini</i>. It was promptly solved after, and I'm glad it did, for it combines two things I don't like (AI brainrot and TikTok) into one unholy abomination.

Then we unlocked the meta, <i>Surviving the Open World</i>. We stared at it for a few minutes, only for Codie to decide to be a saviour once again, then disappear. I watched in bewilderment as he added a mysterious set of letters to form the final answer, with no explanation. It's only after solving it that he told us what it is about - Minecraft. I've played this game before, but thought the cluing was sparse, which would become a recurring theme for some puzzles that reference external knowledge. I don't think an internet-savvy grandma could solve it without some guidance.

The second round opened, the <b>Abandoned Site</b>. The pieces for this round contain information for several puzzles, and you have to find what type of information goes with what puzzles. We quickly figured out that the triangles and squares go with <i>Polygons</i>. I solved it on my own, wheel-of-fortuning the final extract with 4 letters. I was happy to get a geometry puzzle where each shape is used twice, after being defeated by a different puzzle that did this. I moved on to the other round opener, <i>Seven Puzzles</i>, to help solve some of the minipuzzles. After only a couple solved, Max has figured out each minipuzzle is related to bridges and made the connection to the Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg. This made solving the rest of them much easier - I filled in the blanks after being reminded of Jeff Bridges, and after culling the answer pool noticed that some of those remaining are cards in Dominion, and so is Bridge (we definitely needed the bridge aha for that). After all that (and deferring the Contact Bridge puzzle to Max), we were left with four German words, each for one vertex of the graph. We were stuck for about an hour not knowing which German word to put on which island, then Max found out the four parts of the city share their initials with the German answers, so we could finally extract. Not sure which end of the bridge to use each time, we eyeballed it until noticing the extract can end with ZWEI for "two", then got the rest. Then it was time for me to rest. Good puzzle<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a></sup>, but not easy for a round opener. I'm still traumatized by Night Vision's opening puzzles, but I thought at least <i>Polygons</i> was not as hard as any of them.

<h1>Day 3: That's bananas!</h1>

Nothing was solved while I was sleeping, though we got very close to solving <i>Taxononogramy</i>. The only puzzle with all the pieces was <i>Symbolic Computation</i>, where none of us had any idea where to start, so we had to get out of our comfort zone and solve a üçå<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#footnote5">[5]</a></sup>. I looked at my team's previous work on <i>Taxononogramy</i>, a puzzle combining nonograms and chess, and found chess openings named after World Chess Champions we didn't have the pieces for. It extracted to a series of chess moves for the Philidor Defence, numbered C41. However, I saw that someone had already tried guessing it.

Unfortunately, they made a grave error:

<img src="/assets/img/gph-2025-recap/image.png">

Nearly four hours afterwards, I woke up and finished the job. Our first sweet, nutritious üçå.

We unlocked a new round, the <b>(A)isle of Crosswords</b>, but I was afraid of it so I remained in the <b>Abandoned Site</b>. Despite being very Americentric, I looked at the college football puzzle, <i>Not So Fast</i>. We didn't have all pieces for this, but I thought it could be solvable. We identified the matches, as well as the song which we used to order the teams. Then we swapped the letters and wheel-of-fortuned the answer to get our second üçå. I don't like college football, but this was a very well-timed puzzle.

With enough pieces, Max could finally solve <i>Grid Logic</i>, a puzzle that I overlooked but could probably enjoy if I put my mind into it. It gave <i>Questions and Answers</i> the last piece, and I solved that to unlock the round's meta. In hindsight <i>Questions and Answers</i> could probably be solved with a missing piece, but I was fooled by the rare FN bigram, thinking we made a mistake at first, except it was part of the actual cluephrase.

With 6 solves in the round, we unlocked its meta, <i>The Web</i>. The puzzle had room for a 25 pieces arranged in 5 columns and 5 rows. We quickly found out that each answer clues a shape, and its puzzle has as many pieces as the squares in that shape (as such, a puzzle with the answer MAIN DIAGONAL has 5 pieces). This was a fun logic puzzle for finding where to place each piece. We solved <i>Four Square</i> to help with that and, figuring out thay <i>Symbolic Computation</i> gives the bottom 5 pieces, backsolved it. I was perplexed by the meaning of the non-directional emojis until Max pulled off the aha that it's Wingdings (rather, Webdings), which felt really hard if you haven't heard of Webdings before. I've heard of it but it was still tricky. Other than that, great meta! Had fun.

Solving <i>The Web</i> unlocked us a new round, <b>The Crater</b>, with two opening puzzles. Evolt immediately recognize the reference in <i>Dream Team</i> and I, having not heard it, let him cook. I thought this puzzle was not for me, but I later learned it's mostly a word puzzle, so I would've probably enjoyed it. Also, holy shit did Galactic really plant someone in an esports event just for this puzzle. While other people were having fun with <i>Dream Team</i>, I looked at the other puzzle, <i>Convergence</i>, which uses the 8 pentomino-shaped pieces. This was the second time I used the polyomino solver in <a href="https://tools.qhex.org/">qhex</a>, which I last used in 2021 and it became useful again. "Useful" may be a big understatement - I used it for both the big rectangle as well as the smaller pentominoes, and it probably saved me more than an hour. I saw the cluephrase for converging points, and it took Max and I about an hour to understand what this means - a gradual but ultimately fruitful process. We had four convergence points for a while, but then spotted a fifth (in the F pentomino), then the N in the U, and the G in the U if you consider reflections, and both points in the Z. We eventually got all 11 points and solved the puzzle! One of my favourites for this hunt.

<h1>Day 4: Shipwrecked</h1>

It was Tuesday, and Max went on a short trip, so we slowed down. At this point, we generally had no more than 3 people solving simultaneously at any given time. I woke up and looked at the other two puzzles in the <b>Crater</b> round. <i>A Cryptic Has Arrived!</i> featured cryptic clues that use Japanese onomatopoeias in 35 of the clues, and the remaining clues solved to words making up the names of ship parts in Pikmin. I didn't work on this one, but when I woke up, all clues were solved. I, and everyone else, could not figure out what's the source of the background animation.

I looked at the other puzzle, <i>Identify... INDEX, solve</i><sup id="fnref6"><a href="#footnote6">[6]</a></sup>. Before morning, the team identified a lot of the people but otherwise there was still work to do here. I picked this back up, and while searching for the objects on the right-hand side, found out that they're, familiarly, Pikmin ship parts. Finding it strange that these parts appear in two unrelated puzzles, I came to the (correct) conclusion that they'll be used in the meta, we can ignore them for now, and there are probably ship parts hidden in the other two puzzles. So I looked at both <i>Convergence</i> and <i>Dream Team</i> and sure enough, the remaining parts were hidden cleverly in both puzzles, unfound until now. Back to the puzzle at hand, it was clear that we need to index ridiculously large numbers into infinitely-repeating "words". So we did that, and with some cheese, solved the puzzle and unlocked the meta.

This meta, <i>Picking Up the Pieces</i>, went fairly smoothly - we associated each answer letter with a ship part, and put them on five maps. We didn't know the ordering of individual letters (only realizing it after solving), so we anagrammed the big words to make the most sensible-looking answer. We then used the remaining letters to backsolve <i>A Cryptic Has Arrived!</i> and opened a new round, <b>The Atoll</b>.

When the new round opened I gravitated to <i>Bird's Eye View</i>, which contains satellite images. This puzzle immediately tickled me because I used a similar presentation in <a href="https://2022.ecph.site/puzzle/roundtrip.html">Round Trip</a>. I found these locations, and then did the coordinates calculations to find the locations of geoglyphs, which can be overlaid with the doodles to make the shapes of letters. Unfortunately, this puzzle was missing a piece, and try hard as I could, I failed to wheel-of-fortune this answer, and could not find the geoglyphs that we didn't have. I looked at another puzzle in this round, <i>Reduce</i>, and realized that each of the clues has 26 words. Intriguing! Each answer could be used to word-index into the clues to get 3 words from each, but I couldn't figure out yet what these words do yet.

Back in the <b>(A)isle of Crosswords</b>, we still haven't solved anything from it, though there was finally a sign of progress - after thinking very hard and trying four different arrangements of the 13x13 grids, we<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#footnote7">[7]</a></sup> got the main aha for <i>Across The Pond</i>, by solving the cryptic clues for HILFIGER and FRAZIER. The next few cryptics were really hard to solve - as well as the gimmick, we didn't have checking yet, no enumeration, and for all but the first few clues, didn't know yet where they go in the grid, or whether they even go with this puzzle. I joined Max and we gradually solved more and more of the clues. Two hours later, we solved the puzzle! Or we thought we did - POWER BROKER was not the right answer. But it was the right answer elsewhere - the puzzle we thought was <i>Across The Pond</i> (because of British R-dropping) was actually <i>Debbie Downers</i>!

<h1>Day 5: Slow and steady</h1>

Woke up next morning. Nothing new was solved, though Evolt put a decent amount of work into <i>Spooflantu Cultural Exchange</i>. He would continue this entire day, and being afraid to learn a new vocabulary, the rest of us cheered him on. I finally had an aha in <i>Reduce</i> - the second word in each three-word clue is a synonym of "remove". I could find synonyms for the first and third word in each clue, that are different by 1 letter, with the first word having 1 extra letter. These letters can be indexed into the original clues. With three out of four pieces, this gave "WEAKENED AS ? VIRUS" which was enough to solve the puzzle üü¢. We got the last piece for <i>Bird's Eye View</i> and could finally solve that, too.

I went on to look at <i>True Colors</i>, despite it missing an important piece. Two minipuzzles were already solvable. One had colours where one of the components (RGB) was off by some value. The other was an Einstein riddle where you had to assign colours, numbers, letters and days to a group of 7 people. The third minipuzzle was unsolvable without the last piece. We found most of the answers to the clues but had no idea what to do with them, so we left it as is. In hindsight, the üçå dream was never gonna happen.

Back in the <b>(A)isle</b> once again, I was pleased to see signs of progress with <i>Turtles All The Way Down</i> - some of the grid has already been filled by Max and Zomp. I went here and managed to assemble the rest of the puzzle, which has the names of turtles as some of the many unclued Down answers. I discovered that the "Y" piece has some of the Down answers as well. This became a set of two games of Wordle, with the "Y" meaning yellow, and the turtles meaning green, and we solved this tall stack of turtles. I remember saying in the team chat that the crossword round is too much, and there were several things that make these puzzles harder than standard crosswords.

Imagine you're solving a crossword, but there are only across clues and no down clues, the grid consists of many scattered pieces you must find the correct placement for, you do not know which set of clues goes with which grid, and the clues are not much easier than standard crossword clues. That's a lot of factors all put together. The remaining unsolved puzzle in this round also had straight clues and cryptic clues in the same set of clues! If I did this hunt in 2021, when I was still new, this round would've probably killed me. But one we got past the initial hurdle, the remaining 90% of the grid felt reasonable to solve - they were nice enough to give us each set of clues in the correct order, so we could use the lengths of white segments to match clues to grid pieces, and the pieces could be connected to each other using the words going down.

<h1>Day 6: It's not easy Atoll</h1>

Another night went by with nothing new solved while I was asleep, though Evolt has nearly finished <i>Spooflantu Cultural Exchange</i>. Wanting to free him from his prison, I tried my best to interpret his notes and did the unthinkable - learn baseball stats. Seriously, some of these formulae are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runs_created#%22Technical%22_version_of_runs_created">ridiculous</a><sup id="fnref8"><a href="#footnote8">[8]</a></sup>. I managed to get to REN????S before I could spot the thematic answer in Nutrimatic. Evolt was released from Spooflantu hell, and while <i>True Colors</i> was still missing a piece, <i>Mark of Identification</i> was complete.

There was some nightly progress on <i>Pay $7,999,999 To Access The Premium Version Of This Puzzle</i> - I was personally unamused by needing to watch Super Bowl ads to solve a puzzle. I skip ads and sponsorship whenever I can, and this puzzle did me a double blow by being about an Americentric subject that's not strongly clued (ah yes, Roman numerals surely mean it's Super Bowl!). The clues were solved, and most ads were found before I woke up, though I helped solve a couple more. We still couldn't figure out how to put together the grid.

We identified all 5 items in <i>Mark of Identification</i> but had no idea what p and q are. I thought that for the first time, we became stuck on everything. Except that Max did his magic, and pulled of this amazing stunt: "MARK OF = MARKOV?". It became clear that p and q are not the number of repetitions, but probabilities. We found the p and q for all graphs and indexed the numbers into the sequences to solve the final graph. I thought that the title clue was not friendly for internet-savvy grandmas around the world, but I clocked the Undertale tune as the individual notes of Megalovania before we had the last piece, and passed on the cursed piece of knowledge that Baby Shark's first stanzas have 26 words each. I hope nobody makes a puzzle about this.

Solving <i>Mark of Identification</i> gave us the last piece for <i>True Colors</i>, which immediately answered the burning question of how to solve the third minipuzzle. We got two instructions from it, and used the Wayback Machine to find many hoax colors that were on actual Wikipedia at some point. Seriously, "AuroMetalSaurus"? How mad does someone have to be to come up with this? This may be the most amazing and cursed data source for a puzzle. Anyway, solving it gave the last piece for <i>(Don't) Use Your Head</i>, which we solved a few minutes later, as the easiest puzzle in this round. We were just not tenacious enough to guess the answer without knowing the 4 (or 5) letter word that comes after MILITARY. We unlocked <i>The Atoll</i> meta and I called it a night.

<h1>Day 7: Signal in the sand</h1>

A music theory meta! As a music nerd, this was delightful to see, but sadly I couldn't get the aha that the answers are chords after staring at it for a while. Luckily, Max (a recurring name in this post) got it while I slept. The team assigned notes to all island and most sea pieces. I wish I was there. Unfortunately for my team, and luckily for myself, when I woke up, they have yet to figure out how to extract. This was my time to shine - to use one more shred of music theory knowledge. And I did it - the length of the answers matched the interval between the first and last note in each chord. I jotted down on what letters the sea pieces land and finished the puzzle.

We got a sixth round - <b>The Desert Island</b>. This is a certified Galactic round, and opening it was certainly a moment. Solving 10,000 pieces was impractical, so we had to figure out which ones are relevant, which was a puzzle on its own. I started with <i>Places</i>, a puzzle where the pieces give you coordinates - all of which follow the "Solar System Trail" along the beach of a Melbourne suburb. I found it straightforward, and moved on to the next puzzle, <i>Killer Sudoku</i>, which was another one of my highlights for this hunt. Each piece contains a killer sudoku, but most of them are not solvable. We noticed that some of the numbers in the cages can be too big, and used their periodicity, as well as a 3,333-row sheet, to discover the solvable puzzles. Out of 3,333 killer sudokus, only five were solvable, and the method for finding them was clever. Despite its similarity to part of <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/ouroboros">a recent puzzle from Silph</a>, I liked it. Both puzzles did the same thing in their own beautiful ways, and they do not invalidate each other's existence.

Lastly, we worked on <i>Mazes</i>. This puzzle had 3,334 pieces where the the letters traced by each maze path spell out a book from the Hardy Boys series. They mostly went in normal order, but in some positions, an extra book was inserted, breaking the pattern. These extra books spell out the answer by A1Z26 of their serial numbers. This was similar to a different subpuzzle from the same Silph puzzle, but I thought <i>Mazes</i> was tedious, even when using a <a href="https://ouatu.ro/maze-solver/">maze solver</a> - you had to solve maze after maze to narrow down the search space for each letter or group of letters. And even after finding the answer, getting the rest of the pieces would later become helpful.

At this point, our effective width was reduced to 2 - <i>Across The Pond</i> and the <i>Desert Island</i> meta. I had a choice between the two, and decided to see what I can achieve by banging my head against <i>Across The Pond</i>. We had already found the answers to some of the clues, and noticed that the grid is half-American and half-British, but we were only on the cusp of breaking in. I was thankful for whoever put in KNEAD and NOTHING next to their respectful clues, and used this to finally break in to this grid. It did not take too long to solve the puzzle after this. I thought it was a clever extraction, but it was evil to mix cryptic clues and straight clues together, in a round where things are already mixed together.

We unlocked the <i>(A)isle of Crosswords</i> meta. I was wondering if this is related to silent letters, but we were instead in awe of the size of that question mark. We had to interpret each answer as a question mark clue! I had no idea how he did it, but Max got it in less than half an hour. I only watched. I've heard of teams who struggled with this meta. I thought the idea behind it was inherently Risky, with a capital R.

<h1>Day 8: New shores</h1>

You may or may have noticed there was one word I didn't mention at all until now. That word is "hint". Yes, until this point, we didn't use any hints. Despite being on the verge of doing it a couple times, we were unrelenting. But good things must eventually come to an end. It took the <i>Desert Island</i> meta to finally defeat us.

Last night, we figured out how to use the answers - by shifting the relevant pieces with the numbers, you get distinct groups of numbers, with gaps of either 1 or 2 between the numbers in each group. This felt right, but we still couldn't extract. We thought we need to use Morse, but the gap sizes got us nowhere. We tried more esoteric codes, like Wigwag (which uses 1s and 2s), before finally yielding. Our hint told us to use Morse code, but get our 1s and 2s in a different way. The team members who were awake could still not understand how to get the 1s and 2s, so after I woke up I requested a follow-up. This was enough for Evolt to obtain the answer and solve the puzzle.

We unlocked the supposedly final puzzle - <i>Make Your Own Island</i>. I suspected something was off, because teams who finished had too many more puzzles solved compared to teams who were close to finishing. I speculated this puzzle counts as 6 solves, or that there are puzzles after this one, but they're easy. I was the only one around, so I solved it slowly on my own. After placing down everything except for the non-meta <b>Crater</b> puzzles, I realized the solution looks likes Australia. But it was still not budging. A couple hours later, I realized what the <b>Atoll</b> ordering really was, after reading it for the tenth time, and solved it! I made my very own island of "Ausralia"! We finished the hunt, or did we?

There was one more round, but the puzzles were easy as pie. Okay, we've now finished the hunt for real.

<h1>Thoughts on strucutre</h1>

I liked this hunt! It's rare for me to actually dislike a hunt, but this iteration of GPH was still great. I loved the overarching structure - every meta found its own creative way to use the pieces, except for the <i>(A)isle of Crosswords</i>, which I'm glad did not use them. I thought some of the puzzles used the pieces cleverly, but more could be done with this - for some puzzles, it was clear how to assemble the pieces, and then they became standard puzzles. I classified the non-meta puzzles in multiple contrasting ways:

- Spatial assembly puzzles - piece assembly in 2D space is an important part of the puzzle. For example, <i>Four Pieces</i>, <i>Convergence</i> and everything in the <b>(A)isle of Crosswords</b>.
- Spatial, non-assembly puzzles - it's clear which piece goes where, and after you put the pieces together, it becomes a standard puzzle. Piece position is ultimately relevant for the meta. For example, <i>Chains</i>, <i>Identify... Index, Solve</i> and most things in <b>The Atoll</b>.
- Non-spatial assembly puzzles - piece position is irrelevant, but some other things happen that make puzzle assembly more interesting. For example, everything in <b>The Desert Island</b> and <b>Abandoned Site</b>.
- Non-spatial, non-assembly puzzles - completely standard puzzles. Can only be found in <b>Kero's Workshop</b>.

These puzzles could additionally be unlocked but incomplete, depending on what round contains them. I've personally found the puzzles that leaned into the spatial assembly aspect the most beautiful, and I wish there were more of them. The puzzle fragments in the <b>Abandoned Site</b> and the many pieces on the <b>Desert Island</b> had their own interesting solve paths, but there was a certain beauty to puzzles that contain all of their information on the pieces' surface.

<h1>Closing thoughts</h1>

A highlight of the hunt for me was a personal improvement as a solver - I did something in this hunt that I have failed to do for years, and I did it several times. That's solving a puzzle that I previously ignored, after other people put a lot of effort into it but could not finish. It happened at least 3 times, and despite Max being our greatest aha-getter, made me not doubt once that I have a place in my team.

I encourage Galactic to continue to deliver the hunts they like writing. They do not have to be easy, nor do they have to be hard. I also think that not every hunt needs to be finishable on time for every team. I've heard from some teams that this hunt was more tiring than expected. In this case, it's absolutely fine to not push yourself beyond your mental capacity - your wellbeing is more important than the puzzles, which will remain there for you if you ever want to return to them. For better or worse, big hunts like Mystery Hunt, Microsoft Puzzlehunt and Galactic Puzzle Hunt, as well as small hunts, like CMU or Puzzled Pint, will both continue to exist, and every hunt will have its audience.

I can confidently say I was part of the target audience for this GPH. A hunt will never be perfect, and I did have a few quibbles about narrow puzzle width (they've probably been told that enough), topics I don't like (which reflects on me personally only), and external references that are weakly clued, but other than those aspects, I enjoyed my experience.

Thanks for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è

<p id="footnote1">1. Those who know me can affirm that I like hunts more when I see more of them - for this reason I sometimes solve solo, and I don't enjoy Mystery Hunt as much as small-team hunts.

<p id="footnote3">3. I refused to touch <i>The Blue Theatre</i> because I was avoiding anything related to Blue Prince in order to not accidentally spoil myself. After we finished the hunt, I pulled the trigger and bought the game. I'm now going to recommend Blue Prince to everyone without telling them why it's so good (just trust me).
